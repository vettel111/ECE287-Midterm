Sensor:Vibration Sensor SW-420

Working voltage: 3.3V to 5V

Output form: digital switch output (0 and 1)

Principle:
Usually at any angle switch is ON state, by the vibration or movement, the rollers of
the conduction current in the switch will produce a movement or vibration, causing the
current through the disconnect or the rise of the resistance and trigger circuit. The
characteristics of this switch is usually general in the conduction state briefly disconnected
resistant to vibration, so it's high sensitivity settings by IC, customers according to their
sensitivity requirements for adjustments.
